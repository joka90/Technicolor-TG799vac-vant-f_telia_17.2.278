Version 0.2-mr1 (released 2014-02-18)

* Verify transparent RSA signatures

* Compile on kernel versions below 2.6.31 and above 3.9

* Compile with -g

* Add some scripts to debug the NCR module

* Add a script to ease the comparison between vanilla and NCR versions of
  libtomcrypt and libtommath

* Add the ENFORCE_SECURITY flag to prevent key exportation and importation

* Add NCRIO_LOG ioctl

* Add a 'setkey' module to demonstrate how the provisioning can be done from
  kernel space.
  This module is provisioning the master key with random bytes and a RSA
  private key.
  For convenience, the module expects the RSA private key to be provided by
  a user space program that writes to /sys/kernel/ncr-setkey/rsa_key.

* Add a PERSISTENCE option to NCR.
  This is the best way IMHO to enable kernel provisioning.

  Another option would be to have the RSA key wrapped and exported to the
  filesystem (procfs, sysfs) at a given location.

  Add the 'lskeys' and 'rmkey' tools to give a way to easily see and remove
  all the keys left behind by any NCR examples/tools/tests (that do not always
  "deinit" the imported, generated keys or unwrapped).


Version 0.2 (released 2012-09-03)

* Transparent flag now allows for arbitrary hash sizes.


Version 0.1.1 (released 2010-09-20)

* Added several helper functions to ncr.h to simplify API.

* Added examples of API usage in the examples/ directory.
